## Project structure

### Data-analysis

* `/src:`
    1. `Preprocessing.R`: upload eel data and change column names
    2. `Condition.R`: Calculate relative condition factor accordin to Le Cren
    3. `Link_headwidth.R`: add head width data to the dataset
    4. `Analysis_condition.R`: analyse if the relative condition differs according to head width, nested within maturation stages
